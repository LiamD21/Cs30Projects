    <h1>The Council</h1>

    <p>The council is a skater-made group that governs literally nothing... Why did we create this? For fun? probably</p>
    <p>would you like to know who is on the council? Skip to there <a href="#members">now</a></p>
    <p>The council actually has a complex system of bylaws that help us keep order. Do we need to be kept in order? Not really. However, this is a fun system that is suprisingly more organized, civil and democratin that any modern day governements.</p>
    <p>The council sits atop a letter based hierarchy, similar to millitary alphabets, with word for each letter. Obviously, we do not know all the letters, so some are changed and others, we just call different names because why not. The lowest current letter is z, or zulu, although no one occupies this position currently. A while back, a new position had to be created for various political reasons, so zz was created even lower that z. The hirearchy does not however all have a say in matters. The council is the governing body, made up of the top five positions, a, b, c, d, and e. At this point, it is worth noting that the council is only in existance in saskatoon.</p>
    <p>There are also actually very complex systems in place to determine conflicts of order. The council decides all non council moves and a simple vote by all non involved council members to move someone in or out of the e position. This changes for in council. In council, members are moved after a full presentation and multiple random structured debates fololowed by a vote between all non involved members. Anyone trying to take down the alpha, must compete with them in a all around speed skating competition as well as a physical fight.</p>

    <h2 id="members">Current council members</h2>

    <p>The courrent council members are as follows</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Daniel</li>
        <li>Bon</li>
        <li>Liam</li>
        <li>Fergus</li>
        <li>Luca</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This will very certainly be up for changes within the next few weeks, as the council has decided as a whole that d cannot be trusted with secrets, this means that as he is not rank e, we need a full process to get him off the council. All we need is someone to want to try and get on the council and we can vote for them and he is gone.</p>
    <p>Like previously said, our council truly is an eccelent gouvernemental system and functions better than many real world gouvernements</p>
